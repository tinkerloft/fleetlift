Durable **[Turbolift](https://github.com/Skyscanner/turbolift), with AI.**

Ever needed to migrate an API across 50 services? Fix a security vulnerability fleet-wide? Or just understand what authentication patterns exist across all your repositories before making changes?

This platform makes fleet-wide code changes and discovery manageable.

| Submitting a Task | Workflow in Temporal UI | PR Created |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------|
| ![CLI Demo](docs/images/cli-demo.png) | ![Temporal UI](docs/images/temporal-ui.png) | ![PR Created](docs/images/pr-created.png) |

## The Problem

Fleet-wide discovery & code changes are painful:
- **Discovery is manual** — Understanding what exists across repos requires tedious exploration
- **[Turbolift](https://github.com/Skyscanner/turbolift) dies when your laptop sleeps** — No durability, start over after failures
- **Changes go straight to PRs** — No human input before the PR flood
- **Scripts can't handle nuance** — Complex migrations need judgment, not just regex


## The Solution

A managed orchestration platform that coordinates code transformations and analysis at scale:

| Pain Point | How We Solve It |
|------------|-----------------|
| Script dies mid-run | **Durable execution** via Temporal — survives failures, restarts, network issues |
| No review before PRs | **Human-in-the-loop** approval before any PR is created |
| Regex can't handle complex changes | **Agentic execution** — Claude Code makes judgment calls |
| Need predictable changes | **Deterministic mode** — Run OpenRewrite, scripts, or custom Docker images |
| Don't know what exists | **Report mode** — Discover and analyze without making changes |

## Current Status

This is a working prototype with the core functionality implemented.

### ✅ What Works Now

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|:------:|-------------|
| **Agentic Transforms** | ✅ | Claude Code makes changes with AI judgment |
| **Deterministic Transforms** | ✅ | Docker images for reproducible changes |
| **Multi-Repository** | ✅ | Process multiple repos in parallel or sequentially |
| **PR Creation** | ✅ | Automatic branch, push, and PR creation |
| **Human Approval** | ✅ | Review changes before PR creation |
| **Report Mode** | ✅ | Analyze repos and collect structured data |
| **forEach Discovery** | ✅ | Iterate over multiple targets within a repo |
| **Transformation Repos** | ✅ | Reusable skills and tools across projects |
| **Slack Notifications** | ✅ | Get notified when approval is needed |

### 🔜 What's Coming

| Feature | Phase | Description |
|---------|:-----:|-------------|
| **Campaigns** | 5 | Batch execution across 100+ repos with failure thresholds |
| **Kubernetes Sandbox** | 6 | Production-grade isolated execution |
| **Observability** | 7 | Metrics, dashboards, and alerting |
| **Security Hardening** | 8 | RBAC, network policies, secret management |
| **Iterative Steering** | 9 | Guide the agent with follow-up prompts |

**Key components:**

- **CLI** — Submit tasks, check status, approve changes
- **Temporal** — Durable workflow engine that survives failures
- **Worker** — Executes activities (clone, transform, verify, create PR)
- **Docker Sandbox** — Isolated environment for running transformations
- **Claude Code** — AI agent for complex, judgment-requiring changes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+**
- **Docker** (running)
- **Temporal CLI**: `brew install temporal`
- **API Keys**:
  ```bash
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # For Claude Code
  export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...          # For creating PRs (optional)
  ```

### Run Your First Workflow

**Terminal 1 — Start Temporal:**
```bash
make temporal-dev
```

**Terminal 2 — Start the Worker:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
make run-worker
```

**Terminal 3 — Run a Discovery Task:**
```bash
# Run the smoke test
./bin/cli run -f examples/smoke-test-discovery.yaml

# Check status
./bin/cli status --workflow-id transform-smoke-test-discovery

# View the report
./bin/cli reports transform-smoke-test-discovery -o json
```

Open http://localhost:8233 to see the workflow in the Temporal UI.

## Real-World Examples

<details>
<summary><strong>🔍 Example 1: Security Audit Across Services</strong></summary>

Analyze authentication patterns before a migration:

```yaml
version: 1
id: auth-audit
title: "Authentication Security Audit"
mode: report

repositories:
  - url: https://github.com/yourorg/user-service.git
  - url: https://github.com/yourorg/order-service.git
  - url: https://github.com/yourorg/payment-service.git

execution:
  agentic:
    prompt: |
      Analyze this repository's authentication implementation.

      Look for:
      - What auth library is used (OAuth, JWT, custom)?
      - Are there hardcoded credentials?
      - Is token expiration implemented?

      Write findings to /workspace/REPORT.md with YAML frontmatter.

    output:
      schema:
        type: object
        required: [auth_library, security_score]
        properties:
          auth_library: { type: string }
          security_score: { type: integer, minimum: 1, maximum: 10 }
          issues: { type: array }

timeout: 15m
```

**Run it:**
```bash
./bin/cli run -f auth-audit.yaml
./bin/cli reports transform-auth-audit -o json > audit-results.json
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 Example 2: Fleet-Wide Code Migration</strong></summary>

Migrate from `log.Printf` to structured logging:

```yaml
version: 1
id: slog-migration
title: "Migrate to slog"
mode: transform

repositories:
  - url: https://github.com/yourorg/service-a.git
    setup: ["go mod download"]
  - url: https://github.com/yourorg/service-b.git
    setup: ["go mod download"]

execution:
  agentic:
    prompt: |
      Migrate from log.Printf to the slog package:
      - Replace log.Printf calls with slog equivalents
      - Use appropriate log levels (Info, Warn, Error)
      - Add context fields where useful (request ID, user ID)
      - Initialize the logger in main()

    verifiers:
      - name: build
        command: ["go", "build", "./..."]
      - name: test
        command: ["go", "test", "./..."]

timeout: 30m
require_approval: true
parallel: true

pull_request:
  branch_prefix: "auto/slog-migration"
  title: "Migrate to structured logging (slog)"
  labels: ["automated", "tech-debt"]
```

**Run it:**
```bash
./bin/cli run -f slog-migration.yaml

# Wait for completion, then review
./bin/cli status --workflow-id transform-slog-migration

# Approve to create PRs
./bin/cli approve --workflow-id transform-slog-migration
```

<details>
<summary><strong>📦 Example 3: Deterministic Upgrade with OpenRewrite</strong></summary>

Upgrade Log4j using a pre-built recipe (no AI, fully reproducible):

```yaml
version: 1
id: log4j-upgrade
title: "Log4j Security Upgrade"
mode: transform

repositories:
  - url: https://github.com/yourorg/java-service.git

execution:
  deterministic:
    image: openrewrite/rewrite:latest
    args:
      - "rewrite:run"
      - "-Drewrite.activeRecipes=org.openrewrite.java.logging.log4j.Log4j1ToLog4j2"

    verifiers:
      - name: build
        command: ["mvn", "compile"]

timeout: 20m
require_approval: false  # Pre-vetted deterministic transform

pull_request:
  branch_prefix: "security/log4j"
  title: "Upgrade Log4j 1.x to 2.x (security fix)"
```

**Run it:**
```bash
./bin/cli run -f log4j-upgrade.yaml

# No approval needed - deterministic transforms are pre-vetted
./bin/cli result --workflow-id transform-log4j-upgrade
```

</details>

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Submit a task
./bin/cli run -f task.yaml
./bin/cli run --repos https://github.com/org/repo.git --prompt "Add input validation"

# Check status
./bin/cli list                              # List all workflows
